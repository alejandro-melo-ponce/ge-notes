# General Equilibrium — Lecture Notes

This repository contains the public release of my lecture notes for an advanced course in General Equilibrium Theory taught at Nazarbayev University.

These notes are intended for ambitious students interested in microeconomic theory and mathematical economics. Their central objective is to present general equilibrium theory as the mathematical backbone of modern microeconomics.

General equilibrium is treated not as a computational object or a black box, but as a theoretical structure whose existence, properties, and limitations must be understood. The emphasis throughout is on structure, assumptions, and logical coherence. The development relies extensively on tools from convex analysis, separation theorems, duality, and fixed point theory.

The notes are deliberately proof-oriented. Intuition is derived from the mathematics itself rather than from simplified narratives or numerical examples. Many technically demanding results are proved in full; others are discussed with references provided.

The material is organized into chapters covering:

- Mathematical preliminaries (metric spaces, topology, convexity, compactness)
- Exchange economies
- Production economies
- Core convergence
- Extensions of the general equilibrium framework

Appendices provide background in analysis, linear algebra, and related areas.

These notes are a **work in progress** and remain in an evolving state. They are continuously revised and expanded as the course develops.

This repository contains the most up-to-date public camera-ready version of the manuscript.
